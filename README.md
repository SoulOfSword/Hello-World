# Hello-World
Just my first repository


Hi GitHubbers!

This is my first repository.  I im very interested in coding (I'm still a noob) and other cool things you can do with your terminal. I also love math and physics (I guess that's the main reason why I got into coding in the first place). 
Currently I'm learning C++ and I am fooling around with bash in terminals (don't worry, I have virtual machines!).
